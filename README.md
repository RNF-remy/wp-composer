WordPress Composer
=============

Adding Composer dependency management to WP CLI.

### What is this using?
This package uses a great piece of software called [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/). It provides a command line interface for WordPress management. We are a plugin providing Composer management inside of WP CLI.

### What's Composer?
It's the greatest thing to happen to the web since GIFs, Drop Shadows and dancing cats. Composer is a dead simple JSON-based dependency manager for PHP. For more information, check out <http://getcomposer.org/>.

### So this is complete Composer support?
No, not exactly! Sadly, I'm building this out and I'm trying to make some sweet WP-CLI and Composer integration. But for now, we only support a few command:

- install
- update
- diagnose
- help
- status

If you'd love to help out, please help! Make a pull request and let's get coding!

### Who's behind this little project?
It's just [Sean Fisher](http://github.com/srtfisher) for now! We love the guys and gals from [WP CLI](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli) too!
